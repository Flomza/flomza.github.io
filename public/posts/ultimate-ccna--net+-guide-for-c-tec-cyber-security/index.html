Before the Network+ Exam

You should be able to pass Network+ easily if you complete your CCNA studies(including Network Architecture/Automation).
However, I would look at the Exam Objectives and review anything you need to touch up on.
Some of the things I used or wish I used before taking the Net+ are: Port Numbers for CCNA/Net+ Flashcards, Troubleshooting Methodology Flashcards, & Professor Messer&rsquo;s DNS Records Video. I also wish I finished the last few chapters of the OCG.

Before the CCNA Exam

Complete all or almost all of the Pearson Test Prep CCNA Exam Content. The per volume exams and the full exams share the same content, so I recommend doing the CCNA Volume 1 Exam 1, Volume 2 Exam 1, CCNA Full Exam 3, and CCNA Full Exam 4. Do the per volume exams using Study mode and the full exam ones using Practice Exam mode. Look at your scores from the CCNA practice exams and focus your study on areas you struggle with.
Look at the CCNA Exam Topics and review anything that you are uncomfortable with. Keywords: Troubleshoot, Configure, Verify, & Interpret are all topics I would do more extensive lab study on. Recognize, Explain, Compare, etc mean that it&rsquo;s more knowledge based. See pages 594-595 in the OCG Vol. 2 for a chart that goes over this stuff.
Try to Complete the CCNA Final Lab Exam before taking the test. It helps a ton during the lab sections in the real exam. If you get done early, try to complete Jeremy&rsquo;s IT Lab CCNA MEGA LAB.
Ask the teachers lots of questions to fill as many knowledge gaps as possible before it&rsquo;s too late.
It helped me to use the earplugs that are provided in the testing center. I think that is one of the reasons I had so much time left when I finished, the earplugs just help you focus. Also, a good meal and sleep helps too.
Read the last chapter of Volume 2. It has more in depth test taking tips, a chart of everything you need to be able to configure, and more helpful stuff.

If you fail a Certification Exam

Don&rsquo;t give up hope. These exams are tough. However, failing an exam is one of the best ways to practice the exam.
Immediately after failing, write down in a notebook everything you can remember from the test. You can use your notes about the exam for your own study, but it&rsquo;s against the NDA to share those notes.
Then look at the exam topics list and think about which areas you could improve on.

I also wish I finished the last few chapters of the OCG.</li></ol><h2 id=before-the-ccna-exam>Before the CCNA Exam<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#before-the-ccna-exam>#</a></h2><ol><li>Complete all or almost all of the Pearson Test Prep CCNA Exam Content. The per volume exams and the full exams share the same content, so I recommend doing the CCNA Volume 1 Exam 1, Volume 2 Exam 1, CCNA Full Exam 3, and CCNA Full Exam 4. Do the per volume exams using Study mode and the full exam ones using Practice Exam mode. Look at your scores from the CCNA practice exams and focus your study on areas you struggle with.</li><li>Look at the <a href=https://learningcontent.cisco.com/documents/marketing/exam-topics/200-301-CCNA-v1.1.pdf>CCNA Exam Topics</a> and review anything that you are uncomfortable with. Keywords: Troubleshoot, Configure, Verify, & Interpret are all topics I would do more extensive lab study on. Recognize, Explain, Compare, etc mean that it&rsquo;s more knowledge based. See pages 594-595 in the OCG Vol. 2 for a chart that goes over this stuff.</li><li>Try to Complete the CCNA Final Lab Exam before taking the test. It helps a ton during the lab sections in the real exam. If you get done early, try to complete Jeremy&rsquo;s IT Lab <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p7-MluKAgE&amp;t=1s&amp;pp=ygURSmVyZW15J3MgbWVnYSBsYWI%3D">CCNA MEGA LAB</a>.</li><li>Ask the teachers lots of questions to fill as many knowledge gaps as possible before it&rsquo;s too late.</li><li>It helped me to use the earplugs that are provided in the testing center. I think that is one of the reasons I had so much time left when I finished, the earplugs just help you focus. Also, a good meal and sleep helps too.</li><li>Read the last chapter of Volume 2. It has more in depth test taking tips, a chart of everything you need to be able to configure, and more helpful stuff.</li></ol><h2 id=if-you-fail-a-certification-exam>If you fail a Certification Exam<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#if-you-fail-a-certification-exam>#</a></h2><ol><li>Don&rsquo;t give up hope. These exams are tough. However, failing an exam is one of the best ways to practice the exam.</li><li>Immediately after failing, write down in a notebook everything you can remember from the test. You can use your notes about the exam for your own study, but it&rsquo;s against the NDA to share those notes.</li><li>Then look at the exam topics list and think about which areas you could improve on.</li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/hugo/>Hugo</a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/papermod/>Papermod</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=http://localhost:1313/posts/create-a-website-using-hugo-and-papermod/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Create a Website using Hugo, PaperMod, and QOwnNotes</span>
