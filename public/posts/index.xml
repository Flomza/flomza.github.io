      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is something I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about for a while now, I&amp;rsquo;ve just never got around to doing it, however now that I have time, I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to share my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the past year of studying IT, a topic that comes up over and over again is documentation. We claim that we value high-quality documentation. However, how far are we willing to take this mentality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those in the field know the feeling &amp;ndash; After working on a long ticket, suddenly something causes a click, whether it be an article, video, or verbal communication from a senior technician, the problem now has a solution. You&amp;rsquo;re then left wondering how much quicker you could have completed the task if &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; had documented something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
